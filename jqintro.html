      <p>The main purpose of jQuery is to provide an easy way to use JavaScript on your website to make it more interactive and attractive. It is also used to add animation.</p>
      <p>jQuery is a small, light-weight and fast JavaScript library. It is cross-platform and supports different types of browsers. It is also referred as ?write less do more? because it takes a lot of common tasks that requires many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and binds them into methods that can be called with a single line of code whenever needed.</p>
      <p>jQuery was first released in January 2006 by John Resig at BarCamp NYC. It is currently headed by Timmy Wilson and maintained by a team of developers.</p>
